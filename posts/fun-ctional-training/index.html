    <p>In my training experience, i started like <strong>you</strong>,</p>
<p>jumping and trying a different machine and different type of training but i felt not inside my body I couldn’t move with any pain and my <strong>posture</strong> was stuck.</p>
<p>After my graduation, i discovered the <strong>functional training</strong> this new concept for me and I started to study more about that. I started to buy the first book and then going online and then I have tried a course and then I was starting to <strong>training</strong> myself in that way.</p>
<p>Now I don’t look anymore at the machine but I feel my body and i <strong>move</strong> my joints and muscle for the reason why are created.</p>
<p>The results are I fell more coordinated more flexible and with my posture is improved,</p>
<p><em>Move Soon.</em></p>
